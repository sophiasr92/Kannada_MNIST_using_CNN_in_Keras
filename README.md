### Kannada_MNIST_using_CNN_in_Keras
Developed a deep neural network algorithm using the KANNADA-MNIST dataset based on the train and test accuracy on predicting the handwritten Kannada digits, train and test loss. For the implementation of DNN models, Python and its useful libraries like TensorFlow, Keras, matplotlib, and numpy are used
The Kannada-MNIST dataset is similar to the very popular know MNIST dataset where Arabic numbers are used whereas in the case of Kannada MNIST handwritten Kannada digits are used
